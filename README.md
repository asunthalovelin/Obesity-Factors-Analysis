## Exploring Obesity Factors through EDA and Hypothesis Testing

Understanding the prevalence of overweight and obesity, as defined by the World Health Organization, is crucial for public health. This study aims to identify key factors contributing to high BMI values and obesity. By analyzing gender, age, height, weight, hereditary factors, and dietary habits like High Calorie Food Intake Frequency (HCFIF), we seek to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform interventions and preventive strategies. The ultimate goal is to mitigate the burden of obesity-related diseases by addressing its root causes through targeted interventions and lifestyle modifications.
